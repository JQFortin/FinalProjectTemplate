# Meeting Template

Go through this template in preparation for your meeting with the course staff member. We are not grading you on this template, just will help with questions and discussion. Please note, staff have the right to ask you to schedule a second meeting. The goal is to help you flesh out a reasonable project for this course, so make sure to use these meetings as a resource!

## Project Ideas
What are some ideas for your project? Why does that interest you?

The below is from my last homework:
Idea #1: Personal budget tracker ( track incomes and spendings by category, and give financial advices accordingly )
Idea #2: Book recommendation app ( recommend books based on user's genre, author, and GoodReads rating preference )
Idea #3: Due date prediction app ( predict due date when entering last menstruation date, also report current trimester, current weekly milestone of the baby development as well as customized advices based on how far along the user is in pregancy )

I am more inclined to idea #3, because I am a mother of two, and have been using due date predictor / pregnancy tracker intensively. It is very useful in tracking pregnancy progress and make the journey more informed and more reassuring. 

## What are the big ideas?
How does this address some of the big learning ideas of 5001?

Since the project is going to combine both due date predictor and pregnancy tracker, it will involve some of the ideas below:

(1) Class and objects ( can potentialluy divide into class Due_date_Predictor and class pregnancy_track, and then defining objects and methods under each class)
(2) File handling : for pregnancy weekly progress report, there would be files to store the information and thus proper file handling would be needed. User will also be given the option of jounaling, which will be in turn stored as files. 

** added after meeting: considering multiple user info storage, and add user login section. Store information in .csv files to manage multiple user usage senario. 

(3) Error handling: this probably would be needed in all projects ideas, because errors can happen all the time
(4) Lists, tuples and dictionary: pregnancy weeks and their corresponding developmental milestones would be a good way to use dictionary. 
(5) for-in loop: can be useful when iterate over the pregnancy weeks 
(6) arithmetic operators ( modula especially )
(7) basic user interface design ( may or may not be implemented based on the progress and timeline limitations)

## Code Design Thoughts
Are you including classes or APIs, what about dictionaries? One of the worst things you can do is go into a project assuming you are going to 'hard' code everything (this happens often with text based games, then students get stuck). You don't have to know details yet, but you should think about separation of concerns, and how to divide up your code. 

Yes, classes and dictionaries will be involved. I am not sure about how to use APIs yet. 

due date predictor and pregnancy tracker would be two separate parts. 


## Resources Found
What are some resources you have found already or already have access to? (APIs, libraries, past assignments, etc)

I can look up on information easily on pregnancy weeks, and will check online resources as I go. 

## Timeline
Setup a general timeline that includes research and development, and when you want to have certain aspects of the project done. 

Week #1 Nov 18-22:  Due date tracker, multi-use login info management
Week #2& 3 Nov 25-Dec 6 : pregnancy weekly tracker, info display & journaling, combining codes, testing 
Week #4 9-13 : work on report
